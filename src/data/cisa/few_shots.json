Specific security-related assessments and reliability criteria derived from operational customer environments and known product risk assessments should be included in the requirements. The requirements should take into account security criteria for specific industries such as NIAP, FedRAMP, HIPAA, or FIPS-140 and that are based on Zero Trust principles. Architecture and design documents should address all requirements defined and describe the components, interfaces used, and functionality needed to implement the product in various levels of detail based on the needs of the development group."
